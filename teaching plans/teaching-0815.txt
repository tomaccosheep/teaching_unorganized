I need to check out the turtle module, and make sure that I'll be able to install it onto windows and macs. I should try installing it onto windows first.

I need to show up at 5:30 and have a plan to help Abiba. It would help to find a python module that would help me step through a program, so I should do that. I should just do input(':') probably. I think I could just do small while loops and change indentation.

I could make a python file called double_list, and import that, so that we could play with a double list quickly. It does work well to import local files.

I should message Jen about the turtle module

I should try making a program with pdb.

I also need to make sure that all my files are in the correct locations on all my computers. On my main computer on the class account, I need to make sure that I'll have the correct python files that I want to import. On the chromebook I need the list of labs that I can do, and things that I can generally teach.

I should look at the slack responses too, to check out everyone's code.


To Do:
.Have a plan for Abiba
...Go through lists, while loops
.play with pdb
.Watch the turtle youtube playlist
.Make advanced versions for every lab



I think that I can make my own labs, but to do so I should think about what skills I want them to learn, and I should do it in a mind map format

.teach them random things

...Do lists and lists in lists
......Make three categorical lists inside another list

...Do command line stuff
......Go over paste location


...Introduce list[::]
