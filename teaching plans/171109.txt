Teaching plan:

.Figure out a better system for sending files through slack.
...Tell them to send files to all four of us
......Write slack names on the board
......Have them send a practice message

.Do magic 8 ball lab
...Teach them how to set up and break while loops
......Group code 'catch not cat.py'
.........Write a while loop that runs until you type 'cat'

.Do rock/paper/scissors lab
...Group code a program that has IFs inside of IFs
......Make a program about "Does this kid like this food?" where the user enters the kid's name and the food
......Slowly run through how the program works when we enter different information



.Do optional stuff

...Teach '''{}'''.format()

...Teach them lists inside lists

...Teach for loops, while loops, range
......Teach while loops that break when you ask
.........Write 'catch not cat' together

...Teach dictionaries

...Teach "For i in range"
......Make range an inputed number
......Have concatenation happen with every loop
......Do nested ranges
......Show many iterables, such as strings, lists, ranges

....Do password generator lab
......Group code a program that makes a random two-letter word
......Introduce them to 'import ascii'
.........Tell them to look up the ascii library

...Introduce importing functions
......Teach them not to make files the same name as libraries
......Make a simple math function and import it

...Use Turtle
......Introduce importing files and functions first
...Explain why Turtle has to be imported

Grading lab issues:
*Elyse made a simpler file
*Nick didn't send the file
*Mayra didn't send the file
*Josh K didn't send the file
